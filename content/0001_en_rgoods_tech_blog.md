# Who are we?

[RGOODS](https://rgoods.com) is a *Generosity accelerator*. We help associations and NGOs by offering them innovative
ways to increase their donor base and boost their resources. From solidarity e-commerce shops to online donation forms,
we put all our expertise at their service to help them grow. to help them grow.

A major part of our business involves the development of SaaS software. To carry out these missions, we put together
**an experienced technical team that is passionate about its work and committed** to providing our customers with the
best  possible tools.

Our customers are associations with a very strong social, medical and environmental impact, and we have a duty to
share their values. Our team and our products are therefore designed to be : **ethical, responsible,
inclusive and open**.

# Why publish a technical blog?

Sharing is part of our DNA and open-source is part of our culture. We put this philosophy into practice by
contributions to open-source projects, participation in technical conferences and hosting meetups.

What's more, we have both a love of things done well and a duty to deliver technical excellence
(our customers are worth it). So we sometimes go into depth on certain subjects which, we think, deserve to be shared.

Without any pretence whatsoever, we see the publication of articles as **a simple, constructive and natural way of
participate in the community**.

# What can you expect from this blog?

We work across the entire traditional development chain for SaaS tools hosted in the cloud. Our favourite languages
languages are **Python** **Javascript**, which we use mainly through **Django**, **Wagtail** and **VueJS**.

So it's likely that most of the articles on this blog will be on these topics.

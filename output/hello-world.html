<p><a href="https://rgoods.com">RGOODS</a> is a <em>Generosity accelerator</em>. We help associations and NGOs by offering them innovative
ways to increase their donor base and boost their resources. From solidarity e-commerce shops to online donation forms,
we put all our expertise at their service to help them grow. to help them grow.</p>
<p>A major part of our business involves the development of SaaS software. To carry out these missions, we put together
<strong>an experienced technical team that is passionate about its work and committed</strong> to providing our customers with the
best  possible tools.</p>
<p>Our customers are associations with a very strong social, medical and environmental impact, and we have a duty to
share their values. Our team and our products are therefore designed to be : <strong>ethical, responsible, accessible
inclusive and open</strong>.</p>
<h1>Why publish a technical blog?</h1>
<p>Sharing is part of our DNA and open-source is part of our culture. We put this philosophy into practice by
contributions to open-source projects, participation in technical conferences and hosting meetups.</p>
<p>What's more, we have both a love of things done well and a duty to deliver technical excellence
(our customers are worth it). So we sometimes go into depth on certain subjects which, we think, deserve to be shared.</p>
<p>Without any pretence whatsoever, we see the publication of articles as <strong>a simple, constructive and natural way of
participate in the community</strong>.</p>
<h1>What can you expect from this blog?</h1>
<p>We work across the entire traditional development chain for SaaS tools hosted in the cloud. Our favourite languages
languages are <strong>Python</strong> <strong>Javascript</strong>, which we use mainly through <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Wagtail</strong> and <strong>VueJS</strong>.</p>
<p>So it's likely that most of the articles on this blog will be on these topics.</p>
